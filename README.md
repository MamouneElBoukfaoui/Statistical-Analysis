# Statistical-Analysis

This repository contains commented R scripts of numerous statistical analysis methods. The first script serve as an introduction to manipulating R for data analysis, the following scripts are more complex and are covering a wide range of advanced statistical topics such as multivariate analysis, linear models ( including factorial eperiments, Multiple linear Regression, Analysis of Variance ...) and Principal Component Analysis. All these methods were applied to real world datasets and explained briefly through comments in each R script. These scripts have been created as a solution to the computational problem sheets taught in the module Statistical Methods III at Durham University.(2021/2022)
